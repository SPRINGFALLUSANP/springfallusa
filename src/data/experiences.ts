After the security check, I waited in the main hall, watching others go through their interviews. Some came out smiling, others looked disappointed. My turn finally came, and I was called to the counter where Harry Porter, the visa officer, was seated.

    experience: `Bihan experience padhdai, daar mandai embassy xirya, all thanks to Leo sir, Porche sir, Noob sir, Sanchita for taking my mock.

Got inside the gate at around 7:30 and waited in line for about 45 minutes. First, there was a body check then went outside again as it was cold and I was semi-formal and nervous.

After that, we got inside the main hall for biometric and interview. First, they updated my DS-160, then my photo didn't match so I had to run outside and get a new one clicked. My mom told me not to sit with the lady VO because she wasn't giving visas and suggested I try the Indian counter instead. I went back in, submitted the new photo at counter 3, and did the passport scan. Then biometric at counter 5. Seeing others get yellow slips made me even more scared.

Then my interview turn came. I requested the guy there to please not put me with the lady VO, but he still did.

Counter: 9-10 (forgot exactly)
VO: Strict lady visa officer. Out of about 30 people, she approved only 2, me and one B1/B2.

Me: Hi, Good Morning Ma'am.
VO: Hello, Good Morning, how are you?
Me: I am great Ma'am, how are you?
VO: I am also fine. Ok, why do you want to study Computer Science?
Me: I want to study Computer Science to gain expertise in database management and cybersecurity because I want to work for the Government of Nepal to help them protect their data servers and ensure that their websites and applications function properly.
VO: Ok, so what do you think is the major issue the Nepalese government is facing in Computer Science?
Me: Ma'am, Nepal faces major challenges in cybersecurity and server failures. Government websites and applications often crash. I want to fix that and work in organizations like NITC, GIDC, or the Cyber Bureau of Nepal.
VO: *Looks at my transcript and nods happily.*
VO: So what does your mother do?
Me: My mother (fumbled) ... Ahh my mom teaches (fumbled) ... took a long pause and said, My mother works as a teacher at XYZ school and also owns a tuition centre.
VO: What about your dad? *Looks directly at me.*
Me: My dad owns an Asian Paint dealership and manufacturing firm in Biratnagar for the last 13 years and earns around 27k annually.
VO: *Takes the yellow slip, opens my passport.* Oh, you made your passport in 2024?
Me: Yes Ma'am, I went with my dad and faced a tough situation due to a government website failure, which motivated me to study this major to fix such issues.
VO: *Throws the yellow slip down, keeps my passport, smiles.* You are the first F1 student to receive a visa today, congrats!
Me: Thank you so much Ma'am! *Smiling and wishing her a great day.*

The guard and police stopped me and told me not to scream 'Congrats' inside since others were still waiting. I went outside and hugged my mother 🥹🇺🇲
